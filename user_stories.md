# Class 11 lab - User Stories

### As a market analyst,
- I want a survey that will collect information on what items potential customers would purchase.
- I want a user to choose one item out of three choices.
- I want to tally how many times a user selected each item.
- I want to tally how many times an image was offered as a choice.

### As a user,
- I want clear instructions on how to take the survey.
- I want the images to change once a selection is given.
- I want an indicator when the survey is completed.


### As a developer,
- I want the images to never immediatly repeat with previously displayed images.
- I want images to never be duplicated as a choice.
- I want to remove the ability of the user to make selections once the survey is finished.
- I want the results to be displayed on the webpage once the survey is finished.
